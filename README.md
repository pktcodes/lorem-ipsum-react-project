#### Lorem Ipsum consists of a straightforward user interface where there is a

- **Input** box which takes the number of paragraphs for generating the **dummy/placeholder text** by clicking the `GENERATE` button along with the page title *TIRED OF BORING LOREM IPSUM?*.
- Functionality is 
   - By default when the application loads, the input will be 0 and there will be no paragraphs. 
   - if the input is between 1 to 8, it generates the required paragraph.
   - If the input is given less than 1 i.e., 0, negative numbers, and click generate, the output will be always one paragraph.
   - If the input is given greater than 8, the output will be only eight paragraphs because of the scope of data.
- Data is handled by the `data.js` and styles are handled by `index.css`
- To run the project locally, clone the repo, `npm install` to install the dependencies, and `npm start` to start up the development server on default port 3000.
